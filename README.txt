----------inventoryApp(WT)----------
J Quick - 12-13-21

This is an app designed to practice GUI, database, and data analysis in python by creating a basic inventory tracking application connected to a MongoDB database, using PyQT5 for the GUI.

---VERSION NOTES---
v0.1 - 12/13/21 - J Quick
Item creation and editing is functioning, but creation is missing a success alert so it will create the part in the database but not indicate that anything happened, added that to the TODO. Basic GUI is set up, with some placeholder menu options for screens that have not been completed yet. Initial commit on the project has everything mentioned so far.




---TODO---
1) Complete item creation by adding messagebox success alert for database transaction.
2) Add stock listing view page
3) Add issue/recieve page
4) Add analysis/reporting functions
